##	GENERAL INFO	##

Name:		Nomaden
Version:	1.0
Made by:	Victor Sollerhed and Ivan Perisa

Purpose:	
Nomaden is an application that automates the task of logging in to the Chalmers NOMAD wireless network, without requiring the user to start a web browser and type his username and password. 


##	INSTALLATION	##

1. Should have been done nicely by our installer. Otherwise, try again or contact us. 
2. Configuration of your username and password is done with the NomadenInstaller.jar file, which is executed automagically after the installer. Also found on your desktop if needed. Otherwise you can just delete it. 
3. Run Nomaden.app and voila!


##	HOW DOES IT WORK?	##

Nomaden loads your username and password from the file ~/.nomad-credentials.txt and sends a HTTP REQUEST to https://login.nomad.chalmers.se/ with your username and password to log in. 


##	HELP!	##

"Where are my login credentials saved?"
They are saved in the "~/.nomad-credentials.txt" file. If you want to edit them, either run the NomadenInstaller.jar file or this command in a Terminal.app window:

	open -a TextEdit ~/.nomad-credentials.txt

"I have another question, where can I reach you?"
Email your questions, feedback or love to victor@sollerhed.se
